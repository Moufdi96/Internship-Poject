# Internship-Poject

My mission In this internship was to develop an Android mobile application that I named “PepperPhysio” which vulgarizes the use of Pepper robot (softbank robotics) for the physiotherapists in the first place and the patients or the elderly as well, the applications is meant to serve as an interface which enables the therapist to train Pepper to imitate and perform sportive and physiotherapeutic exercises without the need of having prior knowledge of humanoid robots or explicitly dealing with any programming. This can be fulfilled using the amazing feature of Pepper called “Animation mode” which allows to deactivate the joints stiffness so that its limbs are loosened and therefore can be manipulated by the physiotherapist and taught to perform a specific movement without writing a single line of code. The mobile app provides the possibility to :
Connect to a robot (Pepper or any other softbank robots).
Create or delete an exercise.
Train Pepper.
Make Pepper perform an exercise for the elderly/patients.
Give instructions to the elderly/patients while performing an exercise.
Record and add a demonstration video for an exercise.
The last feature is useful in two situations, the first is when the physiotherapist wants to schedule some extra between-sessions exercises to be carried out at home but the elderly/patient has no personal Pepper or has just  limited access to it, in that case the physiotherapist can simply record a video for the robot after a new exercise is created so that it can be watched later as an alternative assistance support. The second situation is when the robot cannot perform an exercise due to some mechanical constraints, for instance Pepper cannot kneel because the hip joint can operate only in a small range of angles (between -59.5° - 59.5° pitch and -29.5° - 29.5° roll), so in that case a video can be recorded for a person performing this exercise rather than the robot.
Another feature that was supposed to be implemented also which makes it possible for the physiotherapist to create complete sessions containing many different exercises personalized according to the need of each elderly/patient, but unfortunately due to lack of time (Laboratory closed because of corona crisis) I wasn’t able to make it, thus only simple exercise can be created so far.
