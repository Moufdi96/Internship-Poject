# Internship-Poject

My mission In this internship was to develop an Android mobile application that I named “PepperPhysio” which vulgarizes the use of Pepper robot (softbank robotics) for the physiotherapists in the first place and the patients or the elderly as well, the applications is meant to serve as an interface which enables the therapist to train Pepper to imitate and perform sportive and physiotherapeutic exercises without the need of having prior knowledge of humanoid robots or explicitly dealing with any programming. This can be fulfilled using the amazing feature of Pepper called “Animation mode” which allows to deactivate the joints stiffness so that its limbs are loosened and therefore can be manipulated by the physiotherapist and taught to perform a specific movement without writing a single line of code.

Note that this application works only with softbank robotics robots (Pepper, Nao and Romeo)

 - Install the Android mobile application "PepperApp"
 - Add the behaviour project "PepperChoregraphe" to your robot using Choregraphe software.
 - Connect to a robot (Pepper or any other softbank robots) by giving the IP adress the port and the name of the robot, Make sure the smart phone and the robot are connected to the same network otherwise it will not work.
 
 when the connection is done you can :
 - Create or delete an exercise.
 - Train Pepper using the animation mode feature. 
 - Make Pepper perform an exercise for the elderly/patients.
 - Give instructions to the elderly/patients while performing an exercise.
 - Record and add a demonstration video for an exercise.
